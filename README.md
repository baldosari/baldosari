### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bushra Aldosari, a current student at the University of Melbourne. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. After my bachelor's graduation, I worked as a teaching assistant at King Khalid University in Saudi Arabia for almost five years. During these years, besides my teaching work, I supervised a technical club at the college (Digital Minds Club) aiming to give computer science students a chance to develop their practical technical skills. Also, I had the opportunity to be part of IObootCamps as a mentor, organized by the Information Technology department. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has awarded me a full scholarship to complete my study abroad. My current research interest focuses on using modern technology, specifically Artificial Intelligence, to enhance the lives of patients with mental and neurological disorders. I dedicate part of my research time to learning about cognitive neuroscience, primarily to understand what the brain structure tells about mental illness.
