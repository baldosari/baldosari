### Hi there ðŸ’œ

I'm Bushra Aldosari, a student at the University of Melbourne.
I worked as a teaching assistant at King Khalid University in Saudi Arabia for almost five years.
I taught OOP, algorithms and data structures, and Linux operating systems foundations during these years.
I supervised a technical club at the college (called Digital Minds Club) aiming to give computer science students a chance to develop their practical technical skills. Also, I had the opportunity to be part of IObootCamps as a mentor, which the Information Technology department organized.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has awarded me a full scholarship to complete my study abroad. My current research interest focuses on using modern technology, specifically Artificial Intelligence, to enhance the lives of patients with mental and neurological disorders. I dedicate part of my research time to learning about cognitive neuroscience, primarily to understand what the brain structure tells about mental illness.
